        When using Adminer main select view, a cell value that
        looks like a URL gets converted into a <a>link</a>.
        Sadly in other views this is not the case:
          * Data returned from a stored procedure
          * Data returned from arbitrary SQL
        This plug-in should rectify that oversight.
